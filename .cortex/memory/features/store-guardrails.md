# Store-Specific Guardrails (SUPERSEDED)

**Status:** Superseded by `features/category-policies` (2026-02-26)

This feature idea has been replaced by **Category Policies**, which moves all policy/guardrail concepts from the store level to the category level. Stores only determine how and where things are stored; categories are the governance boundary.

See:
- `features/category-policies` — the replacement feature
- `.context/2026-02-26-category-policies-brainstorm.md` — full brainstorm session
