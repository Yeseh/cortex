# Human Profile Schema

The `human/profile/identity` memory should contain:

```markdown
- Full name: [User's complete name]
- Region: [NL/BE/DE/PL/CH/US/Other]
- Role: [Consultant/Sales/HR/Leadership/Other]
- Handle: [lowercase-identifier]
```

If this memory is missing, prompt the user to provide their profile information.
